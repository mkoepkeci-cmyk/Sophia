# Response Quality: Before vs After Comparison

This document shows the expected improvement in Sophia's responses after the knowledge base cleanup and system prompt enhancement.

---

## Example 1: "What triggers a ticket as ready for design?"

### BEFORE (Contaminated KB + Generic Prompt)
**Likely Response:**
> "A ticket becomes ready for design when it's approved in the prioritization phase. The status is updated and the request moves forward to the design phase."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Doesn't specify WHO updates the status
- ❌ Doesn't mention Define phase pathway
- ❌ Doesn't explain automatic task creation
- ❌ Vague terms like "moves forward"
- ❌ Missing complete workflow details

### AFTER (Clean KB + Enhanced Prompt)
**Expected Response:**
> "When the status of the ticket in the Define phase is updated to **Approved** by the **Requesting Clinical Informaticist**, the Define task closes automatically and automatically opens a Design task.
>
> If no Define phase is required, when the **CM PgM** updates the Prioritization status to **Ready for Design**, the Prioritization task closes automatically and automatically opens a Design task.
>
> Both pathways result in the Design task being created automatically by the system - no manual task creation is needed."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Specifies WHO (Requesting CI, CM PgM)
- ✅ Explains both pathways (Define → Design, Prioritization → Design)
- ✅ States what happens automatically
- ✅ Clarifies no manual action needed
- ✅ Provides complete workflow understanding

---

## Example 2: "How is a FETR created?"

### BEFORE
**Likely Response:**
> "A FETR is created when the design phase is complete. The Feature ticket is where IT builds the changes."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Doesn't specify automatic creation
- ❌ Doesn't mention the trigger (Design status = Complete)
- ❌ Doesn't explain FETR acronym
- ❌ Missing details about who/what triggers it

### AFTER
**Expected Response:**
> "The FETR (Feature ticket) is **automatically created by the system** when the Design task status is updated to **Complete**. This is an automated process - no manual creation is needed.
>
> The FETR opens with Phase: **Develop**, where IT builds the actual EHR changes. You can find your Feature ticket in Strategic Planning Workspace > Features List by searching for your DMND number."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Explains FETR acronym
- ✅ Specifies automatic creation
- ✅ States exact trigger (Design = Complete)
- ✅ Clarifies no manual action
- ✅ Tells user where to find it
- ✅ Explains what phase it opens in

---

## Example 3: "Who updates prioritization status?"

### BEFORE
**Likely Response:**
> "The prioritization status is updated by the Change Management Program Manager after the SCOPE meeting."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Incomplete - doesn't mention CI's role
- ❌ Doesn't specify WHICH statuses
- ❌ Missing workflow sequence
- ❌ Doesn't explain what happens next

### AFTER
**Expected Response:**
> "Two roles update prioritization status at different stages:
>
> **Requesting Clinical Informaticist:**
> - Updates status to **Ready for Agenda** after completing Effort Scoring
> - This signals the CM PgM to add the request to SCOPE meeting agenda
>
> **Change Management Program Manager (CM PgM):**
> - Updates status based on SCOPE meeting decision to:
>   - **Ready for Design** - Approved, moves forward
>   - **Needs Define** - Requires Clinical Service Line review
>   - **Denied** or **Dismissed** - Request closed
>
> When CM PgM updates status to **Ready for Design**, the Prioritization task automatically closes and a Design task automatically opens."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Identifies BOTH roles involved
- ✅ Specifies exact status names
- ✅ Explains sequence and timing
- ✅ Lists all possible outcomes
- ✅ Describes automation (task closing/opening)
- ✅ Complete workflow understanding

## Example 4: "Who schedules design sessions for Epic?"

### BEFORE
**Likely Response:**
> "The IT team schedules design sessions for Epic. The CI leads the discussions."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Too vague ("IT team")
- ❌ Doesn't distinguish single vs. multi-team tickets
- ❌ Missing process details
- ❌ Doesn't mention Process Owner role

### AFTER
**Expected Response:**
> "For Epic design sessions, scheduling depends on the ticket type:
>
> **Multi-team tickets:**
> - The **IT Process Owner** schedules the initial design session
> - After that, they hand off to the **Primary Applications Engineer**
> - The Engineer schedules remaining sessions
>
> **Single application tickets:**
> - The **Applications Engineer** schedules all sessions directly
>
> In both cases, the **Requesting Clinical Informaticist** leads the design discussion and facilitates the sessions."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Distinguishes between ticket types
- ✅ Specifies exact roles (Process Owner vs. Engineer)
- ✅ Explains handoff process
- ✅ Clarifies who facilitates vs. who schedules
- ✅ Complete process understanding

---

## Example 5: "What happens when Define status changes to Approved?"

### BEFORE
**Likely Response:**
> "When Define is approved, the request moves to the Design phase."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Doesn't specify WHO approves
- ❌ Doesn't explain automatic task creation
- ❌ Missing task closure detail
- ❌ Vague "moves to" language

### AFTER
**Expected Response:**
> "When the **Requesting Clinical Informaticist** updates the Define status to **Approved** (after Clinical Service Line approves), the following happens automatically:
>
> 1. The Define task closes (State: Closed Complete)
> 2. A Design task automatically opens with Status: New
> 3. The system creates the Design task - no manual action needed
>
> At this point, you must answer the first Design question: 'Is design already complete?' to proceed with the Design phase."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Specifies WHO (Requesting CI)
- ✅ States the trigger condition (CLS approval)
- ✅ Lists what happens step-by-step
- ✅ Clarifies automation
- ✅ Mentions next action required
- ✅ Complete process flow

---

## Example 6: "What does Resources Needed mean?"

### BEFORE
**Likely Response:**
> "Resources Needed means that additional people or resources are needed for the design phase."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Too generic
- ❌ Doesn't distinguish Epic vs. Cerner
- ❌ Doesn't explain WHO updates it
- ❌ Doesn't explain what happens next

### AFTER
**Expected Response:**
> "**Resources Needed** has different meanings for Epic vs. Cerner:
>
> **For Epic:**
> - The **Requesting Clinical Informaticist** updates status to **Resources Needed** to trigger IT resource assignment
> - After this, the **IT Process Owner** assigns IT resources and updates status to **Assigned**
>
> **For Cerner:**
> - The **CM PgM** updates status to **Resources Needed** after the Design Review Call identifies the need for design participants
> - Regional and IT leaders then have **2 weeks** to add participants
> - The **Requesting CI** can add regional participants
> - **IT** adds Application Groups and Assignees
>
> Once participants/resources are assigned, the **Requesting CI** (Cerner) or **IT Process Owner** (Epic) updates status to **In Design** to begin design sessions."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Distinguishes Epic vs. Cerner workflows
- ✅ Specifies WHO updates for each system
- ✅ Explains what triggers it
- ✅ Lists who adds resources/participants
- ✅ Includes timeline (2 weeks for Cerner)
- ✅ Describes complete process flow
- ✅ States next status transition

## Example 7: "When does IT start building?"

### BEFORE
**Likely Response:**
> "IT starts building when they receive the requirements from the design phase."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Vague "when they receive"
- ❌ Doesn't mention FETR or Feature
- ❌ Doesn't specify status transitions
- ❌ Missing WHO specifically

### AFTER
**Expected Response:**
> "IT begins building in the **Develop** phase, which starts when the FETR (Feature) is automatically created after Design completion.
>
> The build process follows these status transitions:
>
> 1. **Status: Assigned** - IT resources are confirmed, waiting to start
> 2. **Status: Building** - The **IT Analyst** updates this when they begin building in Non-Prod
> 3. **Status: Testing** - The **IT Analyst** updates this when the build is ready for validation
>
> The **IT Analyst** is responsible for updating from Assigned → Building → Testing, and they email validators when Testing status is set."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Explains the phase transition (Design → Develop)
- ✅ Mentions FETR creation
- ✅ Lists exact status progression
- ✅ Identifies WHO (IT Analyst)
- ✅ Explains what triggers each status
- ✅ Mentions validator notification
- ✅ Complete build workflow

## Key Pattern Differences

### Before Cleanup
- **Vague Language**: "moves forward", "the system", "someone updates"
- **Missing Roles**: Doesn't specify exact job titles
- **No Automation Details**: Doesn't explain what happens automatically
- **Incomplete Workflows**: Only partial process explanation
- **Generic Answers**: One-size-fits-all responses

### After Cleanup
- **Specific Language**: "automatically opens", "Requesting Clinical Informaticist updates"
- **Exact Roles**: Full job titles every time
- **Automation Explicit**: Clear about what's automatic vs. manual
- **Complete Workflows**: Full sequence with all steps
- **Context-Aware**: Different answers for Epic vs. Cerner, single vs. multi-team, etc.

- ✅ State exact status names (not "next status" or "approval status")
- ✅ Explain automation (not "moves" or "goes to")
- ✅ Provide complete workflows (not just one step)
- ✅ Distinguish between systems when relevant (Epic vs. Cerner)

Poor responses will:
- ❌ Use vague language
- ❌ Omit role details
- ❌ Skip automation explanation
- ❌ Give partial answers
- ❌ Ignore system-specific differences
