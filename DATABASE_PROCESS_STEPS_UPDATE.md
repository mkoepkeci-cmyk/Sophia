## How to Access the Data

### Via Supabase SQL
```sql
-- Get all steps
SELECT * FROM process_steps
WHERE process_id = '345c95c4-e364-4f71-89ea-676dc8f04c53'
ORDER BY step_number;

-- Get specific phase (e.g., Intake steps 1-3)
SELECT * FROM process_steps
WHERE process_id = '345c95c4-e364-4f71-89ea-676dc8f04c53'
  AND step_number BETWEEN 1 AND 3
ORDER BY step_number;

-- Get Cerner Design steps
SELECT * FROM process_steps
WHERE process_id = '345c95c4-e364-4f71-89ea-676dc8f04c53'
  AND step_number BETWEEN 8 AND 12
ORDER BY step_number;

-- Get Epic Design steps
SELECT * FROM process_steps
WHERE process_id = '345c95c4-e364-4f71-89ea-676dc8f04c53'
  AND step_number BETWEEN 13 AND 17
ORDER BY step_number;
```

### Via Application Code
```typescript
import { supabase } from './lib/supabase';

// Fetch all process steps
const { data: steps, error } = await supabase
  .from('process_steps')
  .select('*')
  .eq('process_id', '345c95c4-e364-4f71-89ea-676dc8f04c53')
  .order('step_number', { ascending: true });

// Fetch specific step
const { data: step, error } = await supabase
  .from('process_steps')
  .select('*')
  .eq('process_id', '345c95c4-e364-4f71-89ea-676dc8f04c53')
  .eq('step_number', 1)
  .maybeSingle();
