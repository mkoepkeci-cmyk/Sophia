## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (`.env`)
4. Run migrations to set up database schema
5. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
6. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Color Scheme

The interface uses phase-specific colors throughout:
- **Header**: Purple to Blue gradient
- **User Messages**: Blue (#4169E1)
