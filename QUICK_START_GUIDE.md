# Sophia Knowledge Base Improvements - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Done

✅ **Cleaned Knowledge Base** - Removed 300+ lines of chat artifacts, fixed formatting, added explicit automation triggers
✅ **Enhanced AI Instructions** - Claude now provides specific, detailed answers with exact roles and automation details
✅ **Added Analytics** - Track all questions, feedback, and knowledge gaps in Supabase
✅ **Increased Response Length** - Doubled max tokens from 2,048 to 4,096 for more complete answers
✅ **Build Verified** - All changes compile successfully

---

## Files Changed

### Knowledge Base
- **File**: `/knowledge/Comprehensive FAQ for EHR Governance Process.md`
- **Change**: Cleaned from 1,491 lines to 589 lines of pure knowledge
- **Impact**: Claude now receives focused, accurate information

### AI Service
- **File**: `/src/services/claudeService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - New system prompt with "CRITICAL RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS"
  - Max tokens increased to 4,096
  - Explicit instructions for specific, detailed answers

### Analytics
- **New File**: `/src/services/analyticsService.ts`
- **Database**: 3 new tables + 1 view in Supabase
- **Integration**: Auto-logs all Q&A interactions

---

## What to Expect

### Before
"Requests move past prioritization when they're approved."

### After
"When the CM PgM updates the Prioritization status to Ready for Design, the Prioritization task closes automatically and automatically opens a Design task. If no Define phase is required, this happens immediately. If Define is needed, the Design task opens after the Requesting Clinical Informaticist updates the Define status to Approved."

**Key Improvements:**
- Exact role names (CM PgM, Requesting Clinical Informaticist)
- Specific status names (Ready for Design, Approved)
- Automation details ("closes automatically and automatically opens")
- Complete workflow explanation

---

## Test It Now

Ask Sophia these questions:

1. "What triggers a ticket as ready for design?"
2. "How is a FETR created?"
3. "Who updates prioritization status?"
4. "What happens when Define status changes to Approved?"
5. "Who schedules design sessions for Epic?"

**Expected**: Specific responses with exact roles, statuses, and automation details

---

## Monitor Analytics

### Check Supabase Tables

**sophia_questions** - All Q&A interactions
```sql
SELECT question, response, response_length, created_at
FROM sophia_questions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**sophia_knowledge_gaps** - Questions needing better answers
```sql
SELECT question_pattern, frequency, avg_response_length
FROM sophia_knowledge_gaps
WHERE needs_improvement = true
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

**sophia_analytics** - Daily summary
```sql
SELECT * FROM sophia_analytics
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

---

## Next Steps

### Week 1-2: Test & Monitor
1. Use Sophia regularly with real questions
2. Check analytics tables weekly
3. Note any questions with poor responses

### Week 3-4: Evaluate
1. Run analytics queries to measure quality
2. Calculate positive vs. negative feedback ratio
3. Review knowledge gaps table

### Decision Point (Week 4)
**If 90%+ quality**: Continue with current approach ✅
**If <90% quality**: Consider Phase 2 (semantic search with embeddings) ⚠️

## Quick Wins

### Fix a Knowledge Gap
1. Find gap: `SELECT * FROM sophia_knowledge_gaps ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 1;`
2. Research the correct answer
3. Add detailed Q&A to knowledge base
4. Test the question again
5. Mark as resolved in database

### Improve a Response
1. Find poor response in `sophia_questions` table
2. Check what's missing (role? automation? status?)
3. Update knowledge base with missing details
4. Test again to verify improvement

## Getting Help

### Response Quality Issues
- **Problem**: Vague responses
- **Solution**: Check knowledge base has explicit automation triggers and role names
- **Reference**: `RESPONSE_QUALITY_EXAMPLES.md`

### Database Issues
- **Problem**: No analytics data
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify Supabase connection
- **Reference**: `ANALYTICS_USAGE_GUIDE.md`

### Knowledge Base Updates
- **Problem**: Need to add new content
- **Solution**: Follow existing Q&A format, include WHO/WHAT/WHEN details
- **Reference**: Look at existing Q&As in cleaned knowledge base

---

## Documentation

- **KNOWLEDGE_BASE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - Complete overview of all changes
- **ANALYTICS_USAGE_GUIDE.md** - How to query and use analytics
- **RESPONSE_QUALITY_EXAMPLES.md** - Before/after comparison with examples
- **This file** - Quick reference for getting started

## Success Metrics

### Target Goals (4 Weeks)
- **Response Specificity**: 90%+ include exact roles/statuses
- **User Satisfaction**: 80%+ positive feedback
- **Knowledge Gaps**: <5 frequently asked questions without good answers
- **Average Response Length**: >300 characters

### How to Measure
```sql
-- Response quality
SELECT
  AVG(response_length) as avg_length,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN response_length < 200 THEN 1 END) as short_responses,
  COUNT(*) as total_responses
FROM sophia_questions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- User satisfaction
SELECT
  COUNT(CASE WHEN feedback_type = 'thumbs_up' THEN 1 END) as positive,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN feedback_type = 'thumbs_down' THEN 1 END) as negative,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN feedback_type = 'thumbs_up' THEN 1 END) /
    NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0), 1) as satisfaction_rate
FROM sophia_feedback
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Knowledge gaps
SELECT COUNT(*) as gap_count
FROM sophia_knowledge_gaps
WHERE needs_improvement = true
  AND frequency >= 3;
```

## Summary

The knowledge base is now clean and structured. Claude has explicit instructions to provide specific, detailed answers. Analytics tracking is in place to measure success. Test the improvements and monitor the data to determine if further optimization is needed.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for use
**Next Action**: Use Sophia and monitor response quality
**Timeline**: Evaluate results in 2-4 weeks
